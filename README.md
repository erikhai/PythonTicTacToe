# TicTacToe
This project was used to create a simple tic tac toe game using a GUI. The aim of this project was to develop a foundation of how to create a GUI using python and to also create a digital version of a childhood game.

##What did I learn from this project
1. To create a GUI, I need to implement the tkinter module. Tkinter is the toolkit python uses to create a GUI.
2. Before creating any modules, we must always first define the GUI properties such as its name, dimensions, scalability etc.
3. I learnt about the usuage of Frame. Frame is a rectangular area that allows me to place and organise widgets on the window. By using frame.pack() and grid, I was able to display the 3x3 game tiles.
